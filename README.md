# MegaMillySim

## Description

This is a simply python script to simulate playing a ton of games in one of America's most popular lotteries.  This script
helps to provide context around just how difficult it is for a individual, buying 1-2 lottery tickets a week, to hit the
lottery jackpot.  And no, it's not impossible to hit the jackpot, but practically speaking, it does seem to be humanly
impossible, as running this script will help to show.

## To Run

```
python loterysim.py
```
